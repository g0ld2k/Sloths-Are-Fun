How the animal gets food?
 </p>

 <p>
At night, sloths eat leaves, shoots, and fruit from the trees and get almost all of their water from juicy plants. Sloths often descend from trees to defecate. Sloth digestive processes work very slowly, because their food is difficult to process, and because their body temperatures fluctuate every day.

How the animal protects itself from predators
While sloths are lethargic and non-aggressive, they possess 4-inch claws that they use to defend themselves from predators. However, on the ground they can only travel about 53 feet per hour, making them easy to evade.

  <p>
Sleeping habit
Captive sloths typically sleep for 15 to 20 hours per day, while wild sloths rarely rest for more than 10 hours, according to research by the Planck Institute for Ornithology in Starnberg, Germany. Sloths prefer sleeping while curled into a ball in the fork of a tropical tree.
