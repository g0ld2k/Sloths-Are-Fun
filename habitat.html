	Where on Earth is the animal found?
 </p>
 
 <p>
Sloths live in the rainforests of Central and South America. Two species of sloth live there today: the two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth. Both the two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth are nocturnal and move so slowly that algae has a chance to grow on them.

  <p>
What Natural Surroundings does the animal need to thrive?
Environment of a Sloth. Latin America's tropical forests host the arboreal sloth, the slowest of mammals. There are two species: two-toed sloths and three-toed sloths. The former can be 27 inches long; most individuals weigh around 17 pounds. Three-toed sloths measure up to 23 inches and weigh 8 or 9 pounds.

  <p>
Where does the animal make its home?
Their habitat. Sloths prefer sleeping while curled into a ball in the fork of a tropical tree. They also like to sleep hanging by their claws from tree branches. They spend most of their time on eating and sleeping. They sleep for 18 hours a day. The only other thing that they might need to do to leave their tree house is to go to the bathroom or take a bath.
