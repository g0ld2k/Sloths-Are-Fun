<p>
                Gestational Period –
                        Brown throated sloth – 171 days
                        Pale throated sloth – 183 days
                        Maned sloth – 150 days
            How many offspring does it have at a time? Sloths will give birth to only one baby at a time and only one time a year.
How long does the offspring live with the parent? They cling to their mother's belly until they are able to feed themselves, which can take anywhere from five weeks to six months, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. Even after they stop dangling from their mother, little sloths stay by their mother's side for two to four years, depending on their species.
