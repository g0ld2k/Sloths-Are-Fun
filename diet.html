What does the animal eat? A Sloths Diet Consists Mainly of Leaves. Sloths are generalized as folivores or herbivores; they will eatleaves, buds, twigs, fruits and occasionally, insects and rodents. They can however feed from over 50 different types of tree in the American tropical rainforest, but the cecropia tree species is their favorite.

At night they eat leaves, shoots, and fruit from the trees and get almost all of their water from juicy plants. Sloths mate and give birth while hanging in the trees.
