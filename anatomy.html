		Sloths can be 60 to 80cm (24 to 31in) long and, depending on species, weigh from 3.6 to 7.7kg (7.9 to 17.0lb).
		Two-toed sloths are slightly larger. Sloths have long limbs and rounded heads with tiny ears. Three-toed sloths
		also have stubby tails about 5 to 6cm (2.0 to 2.4in) long.

		Sloths have colour vision, but have poor visual acuity. They also have poor hearing. Thus, they rely on their
		sense of smell and touch to find food.
		Sloths have very low metabolic rates (less than half of that expected for a mammal of their size), and low body
		temperatures when active 30 to 34°C (86 to 93°F), and still lower when resting. Sloths are heterothermic ,
		meaning their body temperature may vary according to the environment, normally ranging from 25 to 35°C (77 to
		95°F), but able to drop to as low as 20°C (68°F), inducing [torpor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpor
		The outer hairs of sloth fur grow in a direction opposite from that of other mammals. In most mammals, hairs
		grow toward the extremities , but because sloths spend so much time with their limbs above their bodies, their
		hairs grow away from the extremities to provide protection from the elements while they hang upside down. In
		most conditions, the fur hosts symbiotic algae, which provide camouflage and harpy eagles . There are a large
		number of arthropods associated with sloths . These include biting and blood-sucking flies such as mosquitoes
		and sandflies , triatomine bugs , lice , ticks and mites . Sloths have a highly specific community of commensal
		beetles , mites and moths the pale-throated sloth, the brown-throated sloth, and Linnaeus’s two-toed sloth.
		Incidentally, it appears that sloths benefit from their relationship with moths because the moths are
		responsible for fertilizing algae on the sloth, which provides them with nutrients.

		The average lifespan of two-toed sloths in the wild is 20 years, and up to 30 in captivity.
